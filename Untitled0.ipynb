        "\n",
        "9. How do you handle errors in Flask APIs?\n",
        "- This can be done by registering error handlers. When Flask catches an exception while handling a request,it is first looked up by code. If no handler is registered for the code,Flask looks up the error by its class hierachy;the most specific handler is chosen.\n",
